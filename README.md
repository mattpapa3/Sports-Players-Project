# Sports Players Project
Flask application (propscode.py) used to display graphs/relevant information based on sports player. Regression and classification models are used to try and predict if a player will go over their player prop that a sports betting website will give. Web scraping is used to get the data of the players, and sqlite databases are used to store the data. Currently, it is implemented for the NBA and MLB, but we are always looking to expand to additional leagues and sports. Also, includes a chatbot where you can ask questions on NBA players.
