# Sports Players Project
Flask application (propscode.py) used to display graphs/relevant information of a sports player. Regression and classification models are used to try and predict if a player will go over their player prop that a sports betting website will give. Web scraping is used to get the data of the players, and sqlite databases are used to store the data. Right now the leagues/sports that it is implemented for is the NBA and MLB but always looking to implement more.
